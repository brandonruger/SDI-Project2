<p>For this project I decided to write my story about one of the most important things in my life, and that is my dog Ryder. He is not only my pet, he is a member of my family, and one of my best friends. When I got him, I was not even looking to buy a dog, but as soon as I saw him I instantly fell in love. I couldn't imagine not taking him home with me, so I adopted him. He is the best dog ever. He's so smart and loyal, and he always makes me feel better when I'm upset or stressed. He's a rat terrier, and is currently 2 years old.</p>
